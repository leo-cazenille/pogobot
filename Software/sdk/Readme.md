Overview
========

We designed a robot with motors, SoC (system-on-chip) inside a
iCE40LP8K FPGA chip including a softcore processor, motors, sensors, LED, IR communication.
This SDK allows you to compile and upload code on the robot.

Please visit : https://github.com/nekonaute/pogobot-sdk or https://github.com/nekonaute/pogobot

Requirements
============

The SDK works only on Ubuntu and is tested with Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS and riscv64 gnu tools 8.3.0 and 10.1.0.


Install the dependencies
========================

You need the cross-compiler gcc for the softcore.

From https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex

    mkdir -p dependencies/litex
    cd dependencies/litex
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enjoy-digital/litex/master/litex_setup.py
    chmod +x litex_setup.py
    ./litex_setup.py --gcc riscv
    rm *.tar.gz

Adding compiler in the path (replace * with the correct name)

    export GCC_RISCV=$PWD/riscv64-*/bin/
    echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:$GCC_RISCV\"" >>~/.bashrc

Compile examples
----------------

The SDK comes with somes examples.
To compile and upload one. Please go to the example folder you want to test.

    make all
    make connect TTY=/dev/ttyUSB0

Inside the robot prompt, type "enter" to obtain a new prompt line.
After type the command "serialboot" to upload the code. 


Compile and upload your own application
---------------------------------------

To make a new application, duplicate an example. 
If you move to a new folder, don't forget to change the SDK path inside the Makefile.
